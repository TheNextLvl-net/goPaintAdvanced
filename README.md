goPaint is a plugin that's designed to simplify painting inside of Minecraft.
This plugin is a fork of the [original](https://github.com/Arcaniax-Development/goPaint_1.14) one,
but with many improvements and fixes.
We aim to be always up-to-date and use new technology instead of hanging on to old and dead code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> goPaintAdvanced only supports the latest version of Paper (1.20.6)<br>
> Therefor at least Java version 21 is required
