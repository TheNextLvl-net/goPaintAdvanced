goPaint is a plugin that's designed to simplify painting inside of Minecraft.
This plugin is a fork of the [original](https://github.com/Arcaniax-Development/goPaint_1.14) one,
but with many improvements and fixes.
We aim to be always up-to-date and use new technology instead of hanging on to old and dead code.

## Major Changes

- **Fully asynchrone** - No lags whatsoever
- **100%** customizable messages
- Better WorldEdit integration
- New brushes
- Brigadier commands
- Improved configuration file
- Improved and faster algorithms
- No legacy code or dependencies
- Hangar and Modrinth auto deployment
- New CI Development builds
